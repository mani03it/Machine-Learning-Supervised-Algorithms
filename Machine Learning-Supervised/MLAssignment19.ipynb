    "By using a lot of data overfitting can be avoided, overfitting happens relatively as you have a small dataset, and you try to learn from it. But if you have a small database and you are forced to come with a model based on that. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such situation, you can use a technique known as **cross validation.** In this method the dataset splits into two section, testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while, in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique,  a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a practical problem while building a decision tree model. The model is having an issue of overfitting is considered when the algorithm continues to go deeper and deeper in the to reduce the training set error but results with an increased test set error i.e, Accuracy of prediction for our model goes down. It generally happens when it builds many branches due to outliers and irregularities in data.\n",
